# sweet-world 
This is my first milestone project for the Level-5 Web Application Development program with New City College.<br>
This is the webpage link of my project. <a href="https://abi19x.github.io/sweet-world/">Click here</a>.



**Purpose of Project** <br>
The ultimate purpose was to design and create a website for a bakery shop. The name of this shop is going to be *Sweet World* and their business is selling different types of cakes for special occasions. Customers will have to go to their website, find out what kinds of cakes they have and submit a form to pre-order what they like in store. <br>

I have used four main colors in this project. <br>
*#F7B8DE - which is light pink <br>
*#BF608C - which is dark pink <br>
*DC8DB6 - which is a regular pink as a highlight colour <br>

I have also used 'Inter' and 'Mocondo' to style my fonts which I have imported them Google fonts. <br>

I must emphasize that I took all the pictures and contents of my project from a bakery website and would like to give all credits to this website as I got most of my ideas from them. ![Cake Box Website](https://www.cakebox.com/)<br>
