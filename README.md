# sweet-world
This is my first milestone project for the Level-5 Web Application Development program with New City College.

**Purpose of Project** <br>
The ultimate purpose was to design and create a website for a bakery shop. The name of this shop is going to be *Sweet World* and their business is selling different types of cakes for special occasions. Customers will have to go to their website, find out what kinds of cakes they have and submit a form to pre-order what they like in store. <br>

I have used four main colors in this project. <br>
*#F7B8DE - which is light pink <br>
*#BF608C - which is dark pink <br>
*DC8DB6 - which is a regular pink as a highlight colour <br>

I have also used 'Inter' and 'Mocondo' to style my fonts which I have imported them Google fonts.
