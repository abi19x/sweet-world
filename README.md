# sweet-world
This is my first milestone project for the Level-5 Web Application Development program with New City College.

**Purpose of Project**
The ultimate purpose was to design and create a website for a bakery shop. The name of this shop is going to be *Sweet World* and their business is selling different types of cakes for special occasions. Customers will have to go to their website, find out what kinds of cakes they have and submit a form to pre-order what they like in store.
