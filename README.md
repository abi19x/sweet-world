# sweet-world 
This is my first milestone project for the Level-5 Web Application Development program with New City College.<br>
This is the webpage link of my project. <a href="https://abi19x.github.io/sweet-world/" target="_blank">Click here</a>.



**Purpose of Project** <br>
The ultimate purpose was to design and create a website for a bakery shop. The name of this shop is going to be *Sweet World* and their business is selling different types of cakes for special occasions. Customers will have to go to their website, find out what kinds of cakes they have and submit a form to pre-order what they like in store. <br>

I have used four main colors in this project. <br>
*#F7B8DE - which is light pink <br>
*#BF608C - which is dark pink <br>
*DC8DB6 - which is a regular pink as a highlight colour <br>

I have also used 'Inter' and 'Mocondo' to style my fonts which I have imported them Google fonts. <br>

  <li>I have used <a href="https://designs.ai/logomaker/start/create?company_name=Sweet%2520World">AI designs</a>> to create a logo which is content and colour appropriate for this project</li>
  <li>I have used <a href="https://favicon.io/">favcon</a>, in order to generate the small sized logo icon which I placed on the browser tab.</li>
  <li>I also would like to give attributes to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, for aiding me to style my cards, containers and the whole page in general easily and gracefully.</li>
  <li>Another helpful source to thank in my list is <a href="https://coolors.co/image-picker">Color picker</a>, which supported me to choose a colour palette that goes hand in hand with colourful theme I have chosen for this project.

  <li>Last but not least my gratitude will go to <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/">Pintrest</a>, for providing and allowing me to download elegant pictures with high resolution which worked perfectly with the design and development of my project.
